<h1>`outputs.tf` file that defines outputs for 10 different types of resources</h1>

Certainly! Here's an example of an `outputs.tf` file that defines outputs for 10 different types of resources 
you might use in a Terraform configuration:

```hcl
output "instance_id" {
  description = "The ID of the created EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example_instance.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "The public IP address of the created EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example_instance.public_ip
}

output "bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the created S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket.bucket
}

output "db_instance_address" {
  description = "The address of the created RDS instance"
  value       = aws_db_instance.example_db_instance.address
}

output "lambda_function_arn" {
  description = "The ARN of the created Lambda function"
  value       = aws_lambda_function.example_lambda_function.arn
}

output "sns_topic_arn" {
  description = "The ARN of the created SNS topic"
  value       = aws_sns_topic.example_topic.arn
}

output "dynamodb_table_name" {
  description = "The name of the created DynamoDB table"
  value       = aws_dynamodb_table.example_table.name
}

output "vpc_id" {
  description = "The ID of the created VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.example_vpc.id
}

output "subnet_id" {
  description = "The ID of the created subnet"
  value       = aws_subnet.example_subnet.id
}

output "iam_user_name" {
  description = "The name of the created IAM user"
  value       = aws_iam_user.example_user.name
}
```

### Explanation:
- **instance_id**: Outputs the ID of the created EC2 instance.
- **instance_public_ip**: Outputs the public IP address of the created EC2 instance.
- **bucket_name**: Outputs the name of the created S3 bucket.
- **db_instance_address**: Outputs the endpoint address of the created RDS instance.
- **lambda_function_arn**: Outputs the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the created Lambda function.
- **sns_topic_arn**: Outputs the ARN of the created SNS topic.
- **dynamodb_table_name**: Outputs the name of the created DynamoDB table.
- **vpc_id**: Outputs the ID of the created VPC.
- **subnet_id**: Outputs the ID of the created subnet.
- **iam_user_name**: Outputs the name of the created IAM user.

These outputs provide useful information that can be used by other parts of your infrastructure or accessed after running Terraform commands to manage and interact with the created resources. Adjust the descriptions and values 
as per your specific requirements and the attributes available for each resource type in your Terraform configuration (`main.tf` file).
