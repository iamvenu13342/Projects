<h1>provider.tf` file for multiple resources</h1>

Creating a `provider.tf` file for multiple resources typically involves specifying the provider configuration once, as
Terraform allows you to use the same provider configuration across multiple resourcedefinitions within the same configuration. 
Hereâ€™s an example `provider.tf` file that configures the AWS provider for 10 different resources:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

### Explanation:
- **provider "aws"**: Specifies that the provider being configured is AWS.
  - **region**: Sets the AWS region to `us-west-2`. Adjust this value according to the AWS region you are deploying your resources to.

### Usage:
- This single `provider "aws"` block will apply to all AWS resources defined in your `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files within the same Terraform configuration.

### Important Notes:
- Terraform allows defining only one provider block per provider type (e.g., AWS, Azure) per configuration.
- If you have multiple providers of the same type (e.g., multiple AWS accounts), you can use provider aliases or separate configurations for each.
- Adjust the region and other configurations within the provider block as per your specific AWS setup and requirements.

By keeping the provider configuration centralized in `provider.tf`, you ensure consistency and manageability across your Terraform 
configuration files while deploying and managing multiple AWS resources efficiently. Adjust the configurations as necessary based on
your infrastructure setup and deployment needs.
