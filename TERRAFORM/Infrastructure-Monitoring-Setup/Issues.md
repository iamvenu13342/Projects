<h1>some common issues along with their potential solutions:</h1>

When setting up infrastructure monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana on AWS, several issues might arise. Below are 

<h2>1. Incorrect AWS AMI ID </h2>

**Issue:** The specified AMI ID (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`) might not be available in the region you're deploying to.

**Solution:** Verify the AMI ID is available in your region. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to find a suitable AMI ID.

<h2>2. Security Group Configuration Errors</h2>

**Issue:** The security group rules might not be correctly configured, preventing access to Prometheus or Grafana.

**Solution:** Ensure that the security group allows inbound traffic on the necessary ports (80 for HTTP and 3000 for Grafana). 
Verify the VPC ID is correct and exists.

<h2>3. IAM Role and Policy Issues</h2>

**Issue:** The IAM role and policy attachment might not be correctly configured, causing permission errors.

**Solution:** Ensure the IAM role has the correct trust relationship and the policy ARN is accurate. 
Verify the role is correctly attached to the EC2 instances.

<h2>4. VPC and Subnet Configuration Errors</h2>

**Issue:** The VPC or subnet configuration might be incorrect, causing deployment failures.

**Solution:** Double-check the VPC and subnet IDs and ensure they exist and are correctly configured. 
Verify that the subnet ID matches the VPC ID.

<h2>5. Terraform Module Errors</h2>

**Issue:** Errors in Terraform modules might cause deployment issues.

**Solution:** Ensure the modules are correctly sourced and configured. 
Verify all required variables are provided and outputs are correctly defined.




<h2>General Debugging Tips</h2>

1. **Terraform Plan:** Always run `terraform plan` to review changes before applying them.

2. **Logs and Outputs:** Check the AWS Management Console for logs and the state of deployed resources.

3. **Terraform State:** Ensure your Terraform state is correctly managed and stored remotely.

4. **Module Versions:** Use appropriate versions for Terraform modules to avoid compatibility issues.

5. **Documentation:** Refer to Terraform and AWS documentation for any specific configuration or error messages.

By following these steps and ensuring each component is correctly configured, you can address and resolve common issues that might arise during the setup of Prometheus and Grafana on AWS.
